# Beyond Adjustment

This chapter introduces *do*-calculus as a universal method for scaling mount intervention or in other words uncovering 'true' causal relationships from observational data.

## Background

An expectation is defined as:

\[
E(X) = \Sigma_x x \cdot p(X = x)
\]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value

## Back-door criterion and Back-door adjustment

```{r, echo = FALSE}
crds <- list(x = c(Y = 1, X = 0, Z = 0.5), 
             y = c(Y = 0, X = 0, Z = 1))

pfr  <- dagify(Y ~ X, X ~ Z, Y ~ Z, coords = crds)

ggdag(pfr, node_size = 20, text_size = 2.5) + 
  geom_dag_node(color = "brown") + 
  geom_dag_text(color = "white") + 
  ggtitle("Outcome (Y), Exposure (X) \n
          Confounder (Z)") + 
  theme_dag_blank() 
```

In a linear world this is taken care by the model

\[
Y = aX + bX + c
\]

\[
a = r_{XY, Z^{*}} 
\]

### Back-door criterion

## Front-door adjustment

```{r, echo = FALSE}
crds <- list(x = c(Y = 1, S = 0, G = 0.5, T = 0.5), 
             y = c(Y = 0, S = 0, G = 1, T = 0))

pfr  <- dagify(Y ~ T, T ~ S, S ~ G, Y ~ G, coords = crds)

ggdag(pfr, node_size = 20, text_size = 2.5) + 
  geom_dag_node(color = "brown") + 
  geom_dag_text(color = "white") + 
  ggtitle("Outcome - Cancer (Y), Smoking (S) \n
          Gene (G), Tar (T)") + 
  theme_dag_blank() 
```

Here Z stands for Tar
\[
P(Y | do(X)) = \Sigma_z P(Z = z | X) \cdot \Sigma_x P(Y | X = x, Z = z) P(X = x)
\]

The back-door adjustment is

\[
P(Y | do(X)) = \Sigma_u P(Y | X, U = u) P(U = u)
\]

## Job training example


```{r, echo = FALSE}
crds <- list(x = c(E = 1, SignedUp = 0, M = 0.5, ShowedUp = 0.5), 
             y = c(E = 0, SignedUp = 0, M = 1, ShowedUp = 0))

pfr  <- dagify(E ~ ShowedUp, ShowedUp ~ SignedUp, SignedUp ~ M, E ~ M, ShowedUp ~ M, coords = crds)

ggdag(pfr, node_size = 20, text_size = 2.5) + 
  ggtitle("Outcome - Earnings (E)  \n
          Motivation (M)") + 
  theme_dag_blank() 
```

# *Do*-calculus

Target query is:

\[
P(Y | do(X))
\]

## Rule 1

If a variable W is irrelevant to Y (possibly conditional on other variable Z)

\[
P(Y | do(X), Z, W) = P(Y | do(X), Z)
\]

## Rule 2

if a set Z of variables blocks all back-door paths from X to Y, then conditional on Z, *do(X)* is equivalent to *see(X)*

\[
P(Y | do(X), Z) = P(Y | X, Z)
\]

## Rule 3

if there are no arrows from X to Y

\[
P(Y | do(X)) = P(Y)
\]

## Instrumental Variables

Assumptions:



```{r, echo = FALSE}
crds <- list(x = c(Cholera = 1, WaterCompany = 0, Miasma = 0.66, WaterPurity = 0.25), 
             y = c(Cholera = 0, WaterPurity = 0, Miasma = 1, WaterCompany = 0))

pfr  <- dagify(Cholera ~ WaterPurity, WaterPurity ~ WaterCompany, WaterPurity ~ Miasma, Cholera ~ Miasma, coords = crds)

ggdag(pfr, node_size = 20, text_size = 2) + 
  theme_dag_blank() 
```
